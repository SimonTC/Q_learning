# Q_learning
Code contains a SARSA learner and a Q-learning learner.
It has been created as part of my master thesis 'Combining HyperNEAT and MPF to Create Adaptable Networks'.
It is used in the HyperNEAT-MPF  and the MyMPF programs.

It uses the Efficient Java Matrix Library version 0.26 (http://ejml.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)
